Title:
Make heinzel usable in a threaded environment.

Rationale:
A sqlite connection can only be used in one thread. If used in a different 
thread than the one it was created in, sqlite raises an exception.

Measures:
1. Use multiprocessing instead. 

2. To enable consistent values of model instance fields across processes, a 
new *InstanceInfo._meta* keyword *force-sync* was introduced, which governs 
the process of updating a model instance's field values on every database hit 
that has the model instance as a result.
